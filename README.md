# CompassðŸ§­

The compass guides you to the nearest valuable asset between different browser tabs.

## Valuable assets

- ðŸ‘‘ (compass)
- ðŸ’° (mony bag)
- ðŸ’Ž (gemstone)

The compass only looks for the tabs in which these valuable objects exist, and if two tabs have the same valuable value, it recognizes the first tab and ignores the second tab.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohammadreza4mn/compass.git
cd .\server\ ; yarn start
cd .\client\ ; yarn dev
```

## Usage

To start the game, open a tab and select the compass from the list of roles, open another tab and select one from the list of valuable objects, and now move the compass tab away from the valuable object tab. and move in different parts of the desktop environment, you will see that the compass needle rotates in search of the tab containing the valuable object.
